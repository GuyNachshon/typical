"""PLAN6 item 4: rubric-conditioned typed-workflow corpus (Noul / Choice / Score) in JevBench's *shape*.

Builds data_wf/{train,val}.jsonl + data_wf/eval/*.jsonl + manifest.json (row schema state/query/candidates/
target/p_null/task/label/meta, see data.py). Rows render exactly like pcdm_jev/decider.py at benchmark
time: query = query_text({"type","instructions","criteria"}), candidates = the label strings verbatim.
Nothing is copied from JevBench: every rubric, policy, scenario and label set here is our own; a leak check
against the public JevBench states (exact + normalised stem) asserts 0 hits.

Families (task = wf_<family>; meta.family / rubric_style / qtype / fam_bucket="W"):
  noul   policy_permit (rule engine), adequacy (SQuAD), support (SNLI/MNLI), fact (BoolQ), eligibility [HELD OUT]
  choice routing (intent sets), action_select (rule engine), enum_extract (templates), categorical (topic/
         sentiment with per-label criteria), tool_select [HELD OUT]
  score  quality (yelp/sst5), severity (templated incidents), relevance (SQuAD), completeness (templated),
         urgency [HELD OUT]
Rubric groups (PLAN6 "Queue review"): ~half the rows of the programmatic families come in groups of 2-3 rows
with the SAME state and SAME labels but different rubrics -> different gold (meta.rubric_group /
rubric_variant): policy A vs B in the instructions, permuted per-option criteria over opaque labels,
current-vs-original value, three severity/urgency rule sets, TBD-counts-missing vs -present, thresholds.
One rubric style per type (the last in each *_STYLES list) never appears in train/val.
Eval files: wf_heldout_{noul,choice,score} (held-out families), wf_heldout_style (trained families, held-out
style), wf_rubric_flip (held-out-family pairs (x,r1,A,y1)/(x,r2,A,y2), y1!=y2, meta.flip_pair; scored by
metrics.rubric_flip), wf_rubric_shuffled (held-out rows with another same-label row's rubric -> Δ_r).
