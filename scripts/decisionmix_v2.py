"""PLAN7 Track D: DecisionMix v2 — hard workflow curriculum (data_wh) + uncertainty corpus (data_u).

New module (does not edit workflow_corpus.py, which is being edited concurrently for data_wf). Reuses its
generic, family-agnostic helpers (differing, flip_pairs, shuffled_rubric, leak_check, level_names, cap/lc)
and data.py's row-file helpers (norm_text, group_split, write_jsonl) and the benchmark-time renderer
pcdm_jev.decider.query_text, rather than reimplementing them.

data_wh (PLAN7 Phase 9 "hard decision curriculum"): rule_depth levels 1-7, programmatic gold from a small
rule engine written as data (DOMAINS: field-level (requirement, true-fact, false-fact) triples evaluated in
Python). Every unit is a counterfactual rubric group (2-3 rows, same state + candidate set, different rubric
-> different gold; meta.rubric_group/rubric_variant). Levels 1-6 -> train/val; level 7 (temporal/numeric/
probability/trade-off composition) is entirely eval-only. Holdouts: one rule "grammar" (domain) per level,
3 whole workflow-family domains, 2 whole rubric styles ("terse"/"audit").

data_u (PLAN7 Phase 7A "U — uncertainty"): genuine probability targets. Real annotator-grounded sources —
UNLI's *validation* split (scalar entailment prob; UNLI *train* is already ~fully consumed by data.py's
"unli" E-task and UNLI *test* is already data.py's "unli_test" eval, so both are left untouched here to
avoid training on / duplicating an existing eval set) and metaeval/ambient (ambiguity sets, untouched
elsewhere in this repo). metaeval/chaos-mnli-ambiguity is fully consumed by data.py's "chaos_mnli" eval
already, so it is used here **only** to build our own eval file (read-only reuse of an eval set, never
trained on). Plus four synthetic generators with exactly-computed distributions (partial evidence, noisy
sensor, ordinal confusion, conflicting sources), each with a held-out parameter range reserved for eval.
